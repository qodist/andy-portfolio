My goals are relatively straight forward now and that's to be as good as I possibly can be. I enjoy web development immensely but there's a seemingly infinite amount of technologies, techniques and skills which means learning is endless. I want to navigate as much as possible and as quickly as possible.

At first, I tried to learn too much, there are so many combinations and wanting to be a full stack developer, I was trying to do it all too soon. I've likened it to a desert at times and the grains of sand are the different options you can choose to study and the various levels within. You take forward steps which don't seem too difficult but when you look behind, you can't see where you've been or which direction you've come from, you can easily get lost and that's how I felt after first learning HTML, CSS and JavaScript, I then looked at things like Node, NPM, Gulp, Bootstrap, SASS, Vue, Webpack, BEM, Regex, MongoDB and many other things with an eagerness to advance, though I soon discovered most of what I learned was quickly forgotten.

So now, I've gone back to basics and I'm concentrating on advanced front-end for the time being, learning only what I need to in order to maintain my focus but I'm re-using many of the techniques I'm learning in much the same way I would in an office environment using skills and techniques over and over until they become second nature and thereby I retain everything I learn, which using my desert analogy would be to place giant signposts along the way, tracing my steps, preventing me from losing my way.

My short term goals are to develop excellent front-end skills. Longer term, I would like to master JavaScript.
