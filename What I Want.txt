I want to go from junior to senior developer as quickly as possible, regardless of how long that takes, so to achieve this, I would like to find an environment that looks to nurture, push and challenge me in a positive manner. Surrounded by willing and patient colleagues who still have the time to assist me whilst carrying out their own duties. Given my desire to learn, I wouldn't want to end up in a 'production line' where I repeatedly perform the same tasks on a daily basis to quickly churn out products.

I also expect to be renumerated fairly for my time and efforts. When I first came to Romania in 2004, I was a Casino senior supervisor and I naturally went to the Casino's in Bucharest looking for work. Unfortunately for me, given the local economy, despite each Casino being interested in my skillset they were regretful when explaining to me that they could only offer me a fraction of what I would expect to earn. Fortunately for me now, all the companies that would be interested in hiring me are the ones that target an international client base and have revenues that equal similar companies from the UK, EU or USA, which means the average salary for a junior developer applies in many countries globally regardless of the local economy. Additionally, I believe a junior developer has many levels, perhaps ten levels each with five steps and therefore a salary of €800 per month for a 16 year old child at level 1, step 1 with no previous training would not be justified for a mature junior such as myself who is at level 7 and near ready to almost immediately earn money for the company and begin returning on investment.

Other than receiving regular training and a fair pay, I don't really have too many demands.
