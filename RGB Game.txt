The RGB color game is from the same course as the score keeper app and uses a lot of Javascript. There's a hard (6 colours) and easy (3 colours) level. Each game starts with a randomly generated set of 3 lots of 3 numbers 0-255 to represent an RGB colour. One of the displayed colours is the correct answer and the aim of the game is to sharpen your RGB skills by guessing the correct colour. Once the correct colour has been selected, all tiles will light up with the winning colour as will the display background.
