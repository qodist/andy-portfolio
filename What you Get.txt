You will be getting someone with a motivation, hunger and desire to succeed. Nothing is going to prevent me from making it as a web developer but simply making it isn't enough for me, I want to be one of the best and so I won't be happy until I can build things that only a small minority are capable of building. This may take time of course but I'll be an employee eager and willing to learn at every opportunity.

Whilst learning this past year, I've spent a lot of time on forums and in chat rooms with learners. Naturally, most are looking for guidance so they often link to their projects in order to receive feedback. I've seen hundreds and hundreds of examples by fellow students with the primary objective to make their project functional. The thing that really struck me was that, more often than not (and I'd guess 90% of the time), appearance was an after thought, neglected or the individual lacked the skills or possibly the eye to make their project look good or stand out. If my estimation of 90% is accurate, then that means I am in the top ten percent of junior developers that value appearance. For me appearance is a huge part of it and is just as important as functionality. As crude as it may sound, I much prefer nicer looking things. Currently, my projects look only as nice as my capabilities. The more I improve, the better my projects will look.

Having been learning for over a year, I'm by no means a complete beginner. There are many things and processes in a working environment that I will need to learn quickly, there will be skills and techniques that I'll need to pick up in order to become an effective team member but I don't think it will take me too long to adapt as I've learned enough to be considered competent as a junior.
