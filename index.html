            <div id="history" class="tab-menu__content">
                <h3 class="tab-menu__content--heading">Back Story</h3>
                <p class="tab-menu__content--description">Born in Bradford, England. I grew up with a passion for music, football and travel. Although I was never any good, I'd play football with friends pretty much every day. I also supported the local football team, Bradford City, and I went to watch nearly every game for many years. I used to enjoy discovering new towns and cities when following them to away matches. In my teens, I taught myself how to play guitar and eventually I played in a couple of bands until work got in the way.</p>
                <p class="tab-menu__content--description">Looking back, I often feel a slight regret at not having gone to university, although at the time, I didn't have any idea as to the path I wanted to follow - finance, law and business were suggested but with hindsight, had I taken any of those it would have been a complete waste of time as I have no interest for any of them. The degree on my record would have been nice of course but I still think it's a little insane to ask a 14 year old child to decide their future path.</p>
                <p class="tab-menu__content--description">In the end, my education ended after high school and I tried my hand with various jobs, a printing apprenticeship being the highlight before one day, I was informed of an advertisement in the local newspaper by my mum in which it used travelling the world as bait to lure people into training as a croupier and it certainly got me hooked and so I trained for six weeks and started work at the Bradford casino. I was actually there four years and left only after my mum lost her battle with cancer and not as I had envisioned: to sail the high seas.</p>
                <p class="tab-menu__content--description">The next phase of my life began, I left Bradford for France with a tent and spent the next six months camping in Bordeaux, Avignon and Chateauneuf du Pape, working on campsites and vineyards to pay my way. Then once summer was over and the campsites were closing, I headed to the Netherlands where I heard the tulip season created many jobs for seasonal workers. Working in a tulip factory wasn't much fun so instead I accepted a position installing windows and spent much of my year in Holland working at Schipol airport in Amsterdam where a new wing was being constructed.</p>
                <p class="tab-menu__content--description">After that, I decided it was time to go back to England, though I wanted to go somewhere new and so I went to Bournemouth on the south coast where they had a Casino and immediately I found myself a job. Career wise, I did well in Bournemouth, not only did I start as a senior supervisor which was a better position than I left my previous Casino job in Bradford but within six months I was a junior pit boss, which was a managerial role. However, I entered the Casino profession with one goal only and that was to travel the world by cruise ship and at this point, six years had passed and I hadn't achieved my goal, so remained a big hole which left me feeling unfilfilled. Anyway, after two years in Bournemouth, I finally left for the cruise ships and I spent the next two years travelling the world which was a brilliant time.</p>
                <p class="tab-menu__content--description">Whilst on the ships, I met my future wife, so the next phase of my life began. My wife is Romanian and so since leaving the ships, we've hopped between Romania and the UK but we've been based in Bucharest since 2010. Having worked on the ships, I lost my desire to work in Casino's and since then the challenge has been to find work that is rewarding both financially and emotionally. Initially, I took a role in finance en route to becoming a financial advisor, it was part work, part training and I had successfully completed one of the three exams that I needed to pass to become a qualified financial advisor when the financial world imploded late 2007. That would have made earning money very difficult in commission driven financial roles but fortunately for me, I discovered I had an entrepreneurial side and soon, I was earning 3 times my previous salary, all from the comfort of my home.</p>
                <p class="tab-menu__content--description">More recently, times have been up and down. Having not really played the guitar for a long while, I decided I wasn't as good as I thought I was and so I began practicing quite a lot and while in England last year, I formed a Stone Roses cover band and that was going really well but then my wife got called up for her kidney transplant and so I had to come back to Romania. During this time though, I discovered the most amazing thing. My wife suggested I try to get into coding as she thought I would like it given I'm always on a PC and I too thought I would, though I was dismissive of the idea as I believed I would need a degree or undertake expensive training but I began to look out of curiosity and to my astonishment, I found unlimited online resources teaching all forms of code and so I began to educate myself in web development and for the past year, I've gone from strength to strength and I've absolutely enjoyed every minute of it, I've finally found my calling and I'm now really looking forward to the future.</p>
                <p class="tab-menu__content--description">So that's my life in a nutshell.</p>
            </div>

            <div id="goals" class="tab-menu__content">
                <h3 class="tab-menu__content--heading">Aspirations</h3>
                <p class="tab-menu__content--description">My goals are relatively straight forward now and that's to be as good as I possibly can be. I enjoy web development immensely but there's a seemingly infinite amount of technologies, techniques and skills which means learning is endless. I want to navigate as much as possible and as quickly as possible.</p>
                <p class="tab-menu__content--description">At first, I tried to learn too much, there are so many combinations and wanting to be a full stack developer, I was trying to do it all too soon. I've likened it to a desert at times and the grains of sand are the different options you can choose to study and the various levels within. You take forward steps which don't seem too difficult but when you look behind, you can't see where you've been or which direction you've come from, you can easily get lost and that's how I felt after first learning HTML, CSS and JavaScript, I then looked at things like Node, NPM, Gulp, Bootstrap, SASS, Vue, Webpack, BEM, Regex, MongoDB and many other things with an eagerness to advance, though I soon discovered most of what I learned was quickly forgotten.</p>
                <p class="tab-menu__content--description">So now, I've gone back to basics and I'm concentrating on advanced front-end for the time being, learning only what I need to in order to maintain my focus but I'm re-using many of the techniques I'm learning in much the same way I would in an office environment using skills and techniques over and over until they become second nature and thereby I retain everything I learn, which using my desert analogy would be to place giant signposts along the way, tracing my steps, preventing me from losing my way.</p>
                <p class="tab-menu__content--description">My short term goals are to develop excellent front-end skills. Longer term, I would like to master JavaScript.</p>

            <div id="gain" class="tab-menu__content">
                <h3 class="tab-menu__content--heading">What you Get</h3>
                <p class="tab-menu__content--description">You will be getting someone with a motivation, hunger and desire to succeed. Nothing is going to prevent me from making it as a web developer but simply making it isn't enough for me, I want to be one of the best and so I won't be happy until I can build things that only a small minority are capable of building. This may take time of course but I'll be an employee eager and willing to learn at every opportunity.</p> 
                <p class="tab-menu__content--description">Whilst learning this past year, I've spent a lot of time on forums and in chat rooms with fellow learners. Naturally, most are looking for guidance so they often link to their projects in order to receive feedback. I've seen hundreds and hundreds of examples by students with the primary objective to make their project functional. The thing that really struck me was that, more often than not (and I'd guess 90% of the time), appearance was an after thought, neglected or the individual lacked the skills or possibly the eye to make their project look good or stand out. If my estimation of 90% is accurate, then that means I am in the top ten percent of junior developers that value appearance. For me appearance is a huge part of it and is just as important as functionality. As crude as it may sound, I much prefer nicer looking things. Currently, my projects look only as nice as my capabilities. The more I improve, the better my projects will look.</p> 
                <p class="tab-menu__content--description">Having been learning for over a year, I'm by no means a complete beginner. There are many things and processes in a working environment that I will need to learn quickly, there will be skills and techniques that I'll need to pick up in order to become an effective team member but I don't think it will take me too long to adapt as I've learned enough to be considered competent as a junior.</p> 
            </div>
                
            <div id="requirements" class="tab-menu__content">
                <h3 class="tab-menu__content--heading">What I Want</h3>
                <p class="tab-menu__content--description">I want to go from junior to senior developer as quickly as possible, regardless of how long that takes, so to achieve this, I would like to find an environment that looks to nurture, push and challenge me in a positive manner. Surrounded by willing and patient colleagues who still have the time to assist me whilst carrying out their own duties. Given my desire to learn, I wouldn't want to end up in a 'production line' where I repeatedly perform the same tasks on a daily basis to quickly churn out products.</p>
                <p class="tab-menu__content--description">I also expect to be renumerated fairly for my time and efforts. When I first came to Romania in 2004, I was a senior supervisor in a Casino and I naturally went to the Casino's in Bucharest looking for work. Unfortunately for me, given the local economy, despite each Casino being interested in my skillset they were regretful when explaining to me that they could only offer me a fraction of what I would expect to earn. Fortunately for me now, all the companies that would be interested in hiring me are the ones that target an international client base and have revenues that equal similar companies from the UK, EU or USA, which means the average salary for a junior developer applies in many countries globally regardless of the local economy. Additionally, I believe a junior developer has many levels, perhaps ten levels each with five steps and therefore a salary of €800 per month for a 16 year old child at level 1, step 1 with no previous training would not be justified for a mature junior such as myself who is at level 7 and near ready to almost immediately earn money for the company and begin returning on investment.</p>
                <p class="tab-menu__content--description">Other than receiving regular training and a fair pay, I don't really have too many demands.</p>

                            Natours is a project I did in an advanced CSS course which introduced BEM, SASS and many advanced techniques that impressed me greatly. As a result, to master the skills, I repeatedly implemented many of the techniques in subsequent projects such as the CSS only navigation toggle button.

                            The score keeper app was a learning project as part of another course. As the project focused on the JavaScript side of things, little effort was made to make the project stand out. The actual project was a simple &lt;div&gt; that displayed player names and scores and only counted games (as can be seen <a href="https://codepen.io/qodist/full/NBzdLG/" target="_blank" class="page-link">here</a>), there was just one score. After completing the challenge, I took it upon myself to improve the design and add extra functionality that as well as keeping track of games, you could now have sets. I decided to give it a handheld device feel with a digital display with metallic buttons.

                            The RGB color game is from the same course as the score keeper app and uses a lot of Javascript. There's a hard (6 colours) and easy (3 colours) level. Each game starts with a randomly generated set of 3 lots of 3 numbers 0-255 to represent an RGB colour. One of the displayed colours is the correct answer and the aim of the game is to sharpen your RGB skills by guessing the correct colour. Once the correct colour has been selected, all tiles will light up with the winning colour as will the display background.
