The score keeper app was a learning project as part of another course. As the project focused on the JavaScript side of things, little effort was made to make the project stand out. The actual project was a simple <div> that displayed player names and scores and only counted games, there was just one score. After completing the challenge, I took it upon myself to improve the design and add extra functionality that as well as keeping track of games, you could now have sets. I decided to give it a handheld device feel with a digital display with metallic buttons.
